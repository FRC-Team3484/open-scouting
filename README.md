- Auto jump to the next section that needs filled out
- Have an custom interface for viewing all the collected data
- Have a system for quickly setting up all the required data entries for a new season
  - Have fields to quickly set up and provide to the user when scouting, e.g. "text", "boolean", "data" ect.
