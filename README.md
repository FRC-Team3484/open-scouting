An open source application for easier scouting at First Robotics competitions

## Features
- Save data offline in case of poor connection in the stands
- Work with The Blue Alliance's API to grab match data allowing to autofill team numbers
- Tie multiple clients together into a "session" so all the devices can be sent to the next match simultaneously
  - This will iterate the match number and help autofill some additional information
- Auto jump to the next section that needs filled out
- Have an custom interface for viewing all the collected data
- Have a system for quickly setting up all the required data entries for a new season
  - Have fields to quickly set up and provide to the user when scouting, e.g. "text", "boolean", "data" ect.
- Allow other teams to use it and contribute data to the server
